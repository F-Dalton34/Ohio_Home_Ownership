## Research Questions
1) Which census tracts have the highest renter-to-owner ration in 2010
2) Which census tracts have the highest renter-to-owner ratio in 2019
3) How much do the census tracts with the highest renter-to-owner ratio overlab comparing 2010 and 2019?
4) Does age and income determing this spatial trend?
